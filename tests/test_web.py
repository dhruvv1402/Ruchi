"""The engine behind a browser.

Nothing here re-tests the engine; it tests that a page can reach it and that what comes back is the
same answer the command line gives. Two properties carry the weight:

  * **a verdict reaches the board as soon as it is decided**, because a phantom citation is settled in
    milliseconds and there is no reason for a reader to wait on the ones that need a model;
  * **the quote is located on the server and the paragraph comes back already cut in three**,
    because the normalisation that verified a quote is what has to find it again, and because
    Python counts characters where JavaScript counts UTF-16 units — an offset would agree only
    while nothing in the corpus lies outside the basic plane.
