"""The assembled draft as a document: one structure, two files.

`docs/PRD.md` B7 asks for Indian written-submission format and B9 for a DOCX that opens cleanly in
Word. Those are the same document, so they are built once, here, as a list of blocks — a kind and
some text — and `drafting.word` maps the kinds onto Word styles while this module maps them onto
Markdown. Anything else drifts: a heading added to the Word path and forgotten in the other is a
document that says two different things depending on which file the judge opens.

The order is the one an Indian written submission is filed in: the cause title, the synopsis and list
of dates, the issues for consideration, the submissions issue by issue, the prayer, and the list of
authorities. Then one section that is not part of a filed document and is the reason this tool
exists — the **verification appendix**, which gives, for every citation in the draft, the paragraph
it came from and the words that were matched in it. A person can check the whole submission against
the reports from that appendix without running any of this again, and the disclaimer says plainly
that they should.

Every citation in the body carries its pinpoint at the point of use, because a submission that cites
a judgment without a paragraph number is asking the court to read the whole thing, and because the
pinpoint is the only part of a citation this engine can actually verify.
