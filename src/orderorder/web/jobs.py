"""Verification as a job, so a browser can watch it happen.

Checking a brief is not a request-response affair. With a model configured each citation takes seconds,
and a memorial carries thirty of them; a page that posts a brief and waits is a page that looks broken
for two minutes and then, if anything times out on the way, has nothing to show for it.

So a brief becomes a job. Verdicts are appended as each citation finishes and the page is told about
each one as it lands, which means the board fills in front of the reader in the order the engine
actually works — and a citation that resolves to nothing appears immediately, before the ones that
need a model have started.

The store is a dictionary. The architecture calls for a jobs table, and it will need one when there is
more than one process; there is one process, jobs are worth nothing once the tab is closed, and a
table here would be a schema migration in exchange for nothing.
