"""Who may talk to the engine over HTTP.

The page binds to localhost by default and everything it serves is read-only against the knowledge
base, so on one laptop there is nothing here to protect and a login would be ceremony. The moment it
is bound to anything else that stops being true, and it stops being true in a way that is easy to
miss: `orderorder serve --host 0.0.0.0` is one flag, and the corpus, an upload endpoint and a model
key that costs real money are then reachable by anything that can route to the box.

So the rule is not "add authentication", which nobody does until after the incident. The rule is that
the binding decides:

  * bound to loopback, no token needed and none asked for;
  * bound to anything else, a token is required, and if none is configured the server refuses to
    start rather than coming up open.

Refusing to start is the important half. A warning printed at boot is read once and then lives in a
scrollback nobody reads again, and the failure it warns about is silent — an open server looks
exactly like a closed one until somebody finds it.

The token is compared with `hmac.compare_digest`, not `==`. That matters less here than the habit does.
